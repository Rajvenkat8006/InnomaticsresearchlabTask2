   * A hero section with a welcoming message and a call-to-action button linking to the menu section.
## Menu Section:
   * A section that lists the various drinks and food options offered by the coffee shop.
   * Each menu item should be displayed in a card layout with an image, name, description, and price.
   * The items should be displayed in a responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes (use Flexbox or Grid 
      layout).
   * Create at least 3 menu items for both coffee drinks and breakfast items (e.g., Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino, Breakfast 
     Sandwich, Pancakes, etc.).
## About Us Section:
   * A section with information about the coffee shop. Write a brief description of the shop, including its mission or 
     history.
## Contact Section:
   * A contact form with the following fields:
   * Name (text field)
   * Email (email field)
   * Message (textarea for message)
   * Include a submit button for sending the form.
   * The form should not submit to a server but should have a submit button styled appropriately.
## Footer Section:
   * A footer with the copyright information at the bottom of the page.
## Responsive Design:
   * The webpage should be fully responsive, meaning it should adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   * Use media queries to adjust the layout of elements based on screen width.
   * On smaller screens (e.g., mobile), the navigation bar should collapse into a single column or a hamburger menu.
## Styling:
   * Colors: Use warm colors that are typically associated with coffee, such as browns, oranges, yellows, etc.
   * Typography: Use fonts that are easy to read. Optionally, use a Google Font like 'Lora', 'Roboto', or 'Open Sans'.
   * Hover Effects: Add hover effects on the menu items, buttons, and links to improve interactivity.
## Images:
   * Use relevant images for the menu items (coffee, breakfast items). These should be high-quality images that fit within 
     the design (use images with appropriate resolution).
   * The background image in the header should be related to coffee or the cafe ambiance.
